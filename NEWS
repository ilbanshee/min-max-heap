2015-03-05 Boundary check implemented, better function naming, added simple
           init/free function for heap struct, added peek operations.
2015-03-04 Initial implementation of a min-max-heap based on the paper:
	   Min-Max Heaps and Generalized Priority Queues by
	   M. D. Atkinson, J.R. Sack, N. Santoro, and T. Strothotte

	   The heap structure requires manual management of memory and functions
	   do no check for heap boundaries but data structure is fully 
	   implemented and usable (just copy minmax_heap.c/h on your project).
